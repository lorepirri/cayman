Consistent Estimator
Let {T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, ..., T<sub>&infin;</sub>} be a sequence of estimators (each based on a larger sample size n) for parameter **&theta;<sub>0</sub>**, the true value of which is 4. An estimator is consistent, if and only if the estimators are getting more and more concentrated near the true value **&theta;<sub>0</sub>** as n increases. The limiting distribution of the sequence is a degenerate random variable which equals **&theta;<sub>0</sub>** with probability 1. The following figure illustrates a biased but consistent estimator:
