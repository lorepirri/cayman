Consistent Estimator
Let {T<sub>1<\sub>, T<sub>2<\sub>, ..., T<sub>&infin;<\sub>} be a sequence of estimators (each based on a larger sample size n) for parameter **&theta;<sub>0</sub>**, the true value of which is 4. An estimator is consistet, if and only if the estimators are getting more and more concentrated near the true value **&theta;<sub>0</sub>** at the same time, these estimators are biased. The limiting distribution of the sequence is a degenerate random variable which equals Î¸0 with probability 1.
